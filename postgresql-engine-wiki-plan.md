# PostgreSQL Engine LLM Wiki Implementation Plan

## Purpose

Build an LLM-maintained wiki for PostgreSQL engine internals. Durable prose is backed by pinned PostgreSQL checkouts under `raw/postgres-NN/`.

## Authority

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the source of truth for agent behavior. This plan records the current project shape and rebuild path. If this plan and `AGENTS.md` conflict, follow `AGENTS.md` and update this plan.

Update this plan when the repository structure, supported workflows, or user-facing tooling changes. Do not keep stale workflow steps for scripts or tools that are no longer part of `AGENTS.md`.

## AGENTS.md Editing Rule

When changing or adding to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md):

- Keep language direct and compact.
- Use mandatory commands over explanation.
- Preserve the same enforcement level when shortening text.
- Merge duplicate rules instead of restating them.
- Do not add examples or background unless they prevent ambiguity.
- Check that evidence, citation, verification, bookkeeping, environment, and version-control rules still remain enforceable.

## Core Goals

- Explain PostgreSQL internals through durable Markdown pages.
- Tie every behavioral claim to pinned PostgreSQL evidence.
- Treat PostgreSQL implementation source as primary evidence.
- Allow PostgreSQL documentation and tests from the same pinned checkout as evidence for documented or tested behavior.
- Preserve uncertainty under `## Open Questions` instead of inventing intent.

## Repository Structure

  bootstrap_venv             # creates .wiki-runtime/venv
  recent_log                 # prints recent wiki/log.md entries
  wiki_lint                  # wiki health checks
  wiki_tooling.py            # shared helpers for local scripts
```

Top-level `run_*` files are local launcher scripts. They stay ignored and are not part of wiki maintenance unless the user explicitly names one.

## Evidence Scope

Use only the target version's pinned checkout under `raw/postgres-NN/` as factual evidence for PostgreSQL behavior.

Allowed evidence from the matching checkout:

- implementation source files;
- in-tree PostgreSQL documentation;
- in-tree PostgreSQL tests;
- source history from the same checkout.

Implementation source wins when it conflicts with documentation or tests. Record the discrepancy under `## Open Questions`.

Do not use model memory, external websites, package documentation outside this repository, or uncited prior wiki prose as factual support.

## Version Strategy

- `wiki/versions.md` is the source pin manifest.
- Each supported version has a pinned checkout under `raw/postgres-NN/`.
- Each supported version has a landing page at `wiki/vNN/index.md`.
- New answers default to the primary version unless the user specifies another version.
- Source citations must use the matching `raw/postgres-NN/` path.

`wiki/versions.md` keeps the supported-version table with columns:

```text
Version | Status | Wiki Home | Branch | Pinned Commit | Coverage
```

## Page Rules

- Keep version-local pages under `wiki/vNN/`.
- File pages by `type:` into a per-type subdirectory: `wiki/vNN/questions/`, `wiki/vNN/answers/`, `wiki/vNN/concepts/`. The version landing page `wiki/vNN/index.md` is the only page at the version root.
- Filed answer and question pages are pinned to a single version.
- Every behavioral claim needs a matching raw citation.
- Unverified managed pages must show `(unverified)` in the visible title and index or landing-page link text.
- Follow the tone and readability rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): lead with the answer, use plain language, write short sentences, prefer active voice, and name conditions precisely.

New filed answer pages use front matter in this order:

```yaml
type: answer
version: NN
pinned_commit: abc123...
verified: false
verified_by_agent: not yet
```

New filed question pages use the same field order with `type: question`, and must include a `## Question` section that restates the user prompt verbatim:

```yaml
type: question
version: NN
pinned_commit: abc123...
verified: false
verified_by_agent: not yet
```

## Reading Protocol

Before writing or editing wiki content, the agent must:

- read `wiki/versions.md`;
- read `wiki/index.md`;
- read the most recent ~20 entries of `wiki/log.md`;
- read the relevant `wiki/vNN/index.md` before editing version-local pages;
- use the matching `raw/postgres-NN/` checkout as the evidence base.

Treat `wiki/versions.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, and version landing pages as navigation and bookkeeping context only.

## Prompt Hygiene

If a user question or any prompt that drives document generation contains typos or grammatical errors, the agent must pause before drafting and ask the user whether to correct the prompt issues or keep them as written. This applies to filed `## Question` text, ingest prompts, and any prompt that will be restated verbatim in a wiki page. The agent waits for the user's answer before drafting and does not silently rewrite the prompt.

## Deep Inquiry Default

All user requests, reports, and filed answers run in deep-inquiry mode unless the user explicitly asks for a quick answer.

For each request:

- Confirm the target PostgreSQL version.
- Locate the primary source files and symbols.
- Inspect adjacent callers, callees, structs, macros, includes, generated headers visible in raw source, reverse include users, relevant tests, docs, catalogs, grammar, error paths, GUC definitions, and extension/contrib boundaries.
- If evidence lookup errors or cannot produce trustworthy output, stop and report the target version and error.
- Inspect file or symbol history when intent matters or when a regression/change claim is being made.
- Draft from a claim-to-source evidence map.
- Move unresolved claims under `## Open Questions`.

Minimum depth for an engine-internals answer: normal path, relevant error or edge path, key data structures, caller/callee boundary, build or generated-header implications visible from raw source, and tests or explicit test absence.

## Citation Discipline

- Cite source paths and symbols for every behavioral claim.
- Mandatory citation shape: `[[raw/postgres-NN/src/backend/executor/execMain.c#ExecutorRun]]`.
- For non-Markdown files include the full file extension.
- Cite from the `raw/postgres-NN/` checkout matching the page's `version:`.
- Use aliases when useful: `[[raw/postgres-NN/path/file.c#symbol|file.c#symbol]]`.
- If a claim is not backed by a source file, symbol, test file, documentation page, commit, or saved design discussion, do not write it as fact.

## Verification Fields

Pages carry two verification fields:

- `verified:` is human-verified. Only a human reviewer may set, change, or remove it.
- `verified_by_agent:` is agent-verified. Agents may set or update it only after re-checking every claim against the pinned raw source.

Rules:

- New filed answer pages set `verified: false` and `verified_by_agent: not yet`.
- Do not set `verified_by_agent:` if any claim cannot be verified.
- Unverified managed wiki documents must show `(unverified)` until a human sets `verified: true`.
- `verified_by_agent` must be either `not yet` or `<LLM-model-name> | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.

## GUC Configuration Changes

Whenever a wiki page suggests changing a GUC, state whether the change requires restart, reload, or only session/transaction scope.

Determine the requirement from the GUC context in the pinned raw source or from a validated `pg_settings` definition in the same version:

- `postmaster` -> restart required;
- `sighup` -> reload;
- `superuser`, `user`, or `backend` -> session or transaction scope.

## Production SQL Snippets

Whenever a wiki page proposes SQL intended to run against production:

- Verify syntax, referenced catalogs, columns, functions, and GUCs against the pinned checkout.
- Recommend reasonable session-scoped `statement_timeout` and `lock_timeout` values.
- Add an inline block-comment tag immediately after the leading verb.

```sql
SELECT /* wiki_capture_plan_inputs */ ...;
UPDATE /* wiki_backfill_user_email */ users SET ...;
```

## Bookkeeping

After every meaningful wiki change:

- update `wiki/index.md` when a page is created or substantially changed;
- update `wiki/versions.md` when a supported version is added, removed, archived, re-pinned, or has a meaningful coverage change;
- update the relevant `wiki/vNN/index.md` when version-local pages are created or substantially changed;
- append an entry to `wiki/log.md` after each scaffold change, ingest, lint pass, filed answer, or version lifecycle event.

Log entry headings use one of these forms:

```md
## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> v<NN> | <subject>
## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> | <subject>
```

## Workflows

### Add A Supported Version

1. Add the source checkout under `raw/postgres-NN/`.
2. Pin the checkout to an exact commit.
3. Add the version to `wiki/versions.md`.
4. Create `wiki/vNN/index.md`.
5. Update `wiki/index.md`.
6. Append to `wiki/log.md`.

### Answer And File

1. Determine the target version. Default to the primary version if the user does not specify one.
2. Build a source envelope from the pinned `raw/postgres-NN/` checkout.
3. Check relevant callers, callees, structs, macros, includes, tests, docs, catalogs, grammar, error paths, GUC definitions, and extension boundaries.
4. Draft from a claim-to-source evidence map.
5. Put gaps under `## Open Questions`.
6. File the answer and update indexes/log.
7. Apply the tone and readability rules from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before filing.

### Lint The Wiki

Use project-local scripts from the venv:

```bash
scripts/recent_log --limit 20
scripts/wiki_lint
```

The lint pass checks broken links, orphan pages, missing source references, stale version pins, wrong-version citations, invalid verification fields, unverified title hints, and version landing pages missing links.

## Environment Isolation

- Run Python scripts from `.wiki-runtime/venv/`.
- If the venv is missing, run `scripts/bootstrap_venv`.
- Pin new Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Do not install Python packages globally, with `--user`, via `pipx`, or with `sudo`.
- Read and write only inside this repository.
- Treat `raw/postgres-NN/` checkouts as read-only evidence.
- Keep generated artifacts, caches, and the venv under `.wiki-runtime/`.
- Network access is allowed only for `scripts/bootstrap_venv` or source-fetch work the user explicitly requests.

## Script Changes

- Keep durable project tooling under `scripts/`.
- Keep project-local runtime state under `.wiki-runtime/`.
- When changing script contents, update adjacent workflow examples, lint examples, or tests that depend on the changed behavior.
- Do not document or preserve workflows that are absent from `AGENTS.md`.

## First Useful Milestone

- Supported versions are pinned in `wiki/versions.md`.
- Each supported version has a `raw/postgres-NN/` checkout.
- Pinned checkout evidence is the primary evidence base.
- Wiki answers cite raw source paths and symbols.
- `scripts/wiki_lint` passes.

## Version Control

- Never commit or push without asking for permission.
