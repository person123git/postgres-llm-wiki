## [2026-05-18] review v18 | avg_leaf_density during (auto)vacuum verification

- Re-checked every behavioral claim in [[v18/questions/avg-leaf-density-during-vacuum|Computing and Storing avg_leaf_density During (Auto)VACUUM of a B-Tree Index (unverified)]] against pinned `raw/postgres-18/` commit `6cb307251c5c6261286c1566496920976640108e`.
- Confirmed: `pgstatindex_impl` formula and NaN guard, `PageGetExactFreeSpace = pd_upper - pd_lower`, `_bt_pageinit`/`PageInit` special-space math, `btvacuumscan`/`btvacuumpage` cleanup-lock and reset points, `btbulkdelete`/`btvacuumcleanup`/`_bt_vacuum_needs_cleanup` skip logic, `_bt_set_cleanup_info` early-return + WAL write, `BTMetaPageData`/`xl_btree_metadata`/`_bt_restore_meta` deprecated `btm_last_cleanup_num_heap_tuples` handling, `bt_metap` exposure, `pgstat_report_vacuum` locked-entry + `AmAutoVacuumWorkerProcess` path, `PgStat_StatTabEntry`/`shared_stat_reset_contents`, `pg_stat_all_indexes` columns, `_bt_pagedel`/`_bt_unlink_halfdead_page` non-deletion cases, and parallel-vacuum `sizeof(IndexBulkDeleteResult)` copy with no autovacuum parallel workers.
- No factual corrections needed; design-intent and parity gaps remain correctly scoped under `## Open Questions`.
- Advanced `verified_by_agent` to the timestamp form; `verified:` stays human-only `false`, so the title keeps `(unverified)`. `scripts/wiki_lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

## [2026-05-19] research v18 | avg_leaf_density during vacuum cons

- Added a `## Cons Evidence` section to [[v18/questions/avg-leaf-density-during-vacuum|Computing and Storing avg_leaf_density During (Auto)VACUUM of a B-Tree Index (unverified)]].
- Grounded the cons in pinned PostgreSQL 18 source paths for skipped index scans, metapage write/WAL costs, cumulative stats durability, exact `pgstatindex` parity, concurrent split estimate limits, and parallel VACUUM result copying.
- Updated `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/v18/index.md` summaries.

## [2026-05-17] review-fix v18 | avg_leaf_density during (auto)vacuum question

- Reviewed [[v18/questions/avg-leaf-density-during-vacuum|Computing and Storing avg_leaf_density During (Auto)VACUUM of a B-Tree Index (unverified)]] against pinned `raw/postgres-18/` commit `6cb307251c5c6261286c1566496920976640108e`.
- Narrowed the zero-extra-I/O claim to actual `btvacuumscan` executions and corrected `_bt_set_cleanup_info` storage cost to account for its early-return path.
- Reworked the metapage recommendation to prefer the deprecated `btm_last_cleanup_num_heap_tuples` `float8` slot over a new `float4`, while calling out WAL redo and `pageinspect` implications.
- Added explicit accuracy caveats for empty leaf pages handled by `_bt_pagedel`, plus stats reset, accessor, parallel VACUUM, and autovacuum path notes.
- Updated `wiki/v18/index.md` and `wiki/index.md` link summaries.

## [2026-05-17] lint-fix v12 | add source references

- Added the missing `## Source References` section to [[v12/questions/fk-join-optimization-two-tables|Foreign-Key Join Optimization for Two-Table Joins (unverified)]] so `scripts/wiki_lint` can validate the page.

## [2026-05-17] answer v18 | compute and store avg_leaf_density during (auto)vacuum

- Filed [[v18/questions/avg-leaf-density-during-vacuum|Computing and Storing avg_leaf_density During (Auto)VACUUM of a B-Tree Index (unverified)]].
- Designed accumulation in the `btvacuumpage` `P_ISLEAF` branch via new `BTVacState` sums, derived in `btvacuumscan`, mirroring `pgstatindex_impl` semantics with zero extra page I/O.
- Proposed dual storage: B-tree metapage (piggybacks the existing `_bt_set_cleanup_info` WAL-logged write) and the cumulative statistics system (`PgStat_StatTabEntry` via a `pgstat_report_vacuum`-style reporter), plus skip-scan coverage caveats.
- Cited only `raw/postgres-18/` (commit `6cb307251c5c6261286c1566496920976640108e`); filed `verified_by_agent: not yet`, title carries `(unverified)`.
- Linked from `wiki/v18/index.md` and `wiki/index.md`.

## [2026-05-13] review-fix v12 | foreign-key join optimization question

- Clarified that FK metadata directly affects join row-count estimation, while outer-join removal and semijoin reduction are uniqueness-driven.
- Corrected multicolumn FK matching to state that PostgreSQL 12 retains only fully matched FKs.
- Replaced source citations in [[v12/questions/fk-join-optimization-two-tables|Foreign-Key Join Optimization for Two-Table Joins (unverified)]] with the required `[[raw/postgres-12/...#symbol]]` form.
- Removed the resolved `eqjoinsel` open question after checking the `calc_joinrel_size_estimate` path.

## [2026-05-13] answer v12 | foreign-key join optimization for two-table joins

- Filed [[v12/questions/fk-join-optimization-two-tables|Foreign-Key Join Optimization for Two-Table Joins (unverified)]] covering `get_relation_foreign_keys`, `match_foreign_keys_to_quals`, `match_eclasses_to_foreign_key_col`, `calc_joinrel_size_estimate`, and `get_foreign_key_join_selectivity`.
- Cited only `raw/postgres-12/` (commit `45b88269a353ad93744772791feb6d01bc7e1e42`).
- Filed as `verified_by_agent: not yet`; title carries `(unverified)` per `AGENTS.md`.
- Linked from `wiki/v12/index.md` and `wiki/index.md`.

## [2026-05-13] version-add v17 | added PostgreSQL 17 as active version

- Cloned `REL_17_STABLE` into `raw/postgres-17/` pinned to commit `54eeefaedbee0385529f3edf321bb99e49232aaa` (PostgreSQL 17.10, 3 commits past tag `REL_17_10`).
- Created `wiki/v17/index.md` landing page with status `active`.
- Registered the version in `wiki/versions.md` and `wiki/index.md`.

## [2026-05-13] cleanup | reset wiki content logs

- Removed the remaining filed answer page.
- Removed stale index and coverage references for removed content.
- Cleared older activity entries from this log.

## [2026-05-13] cleanup | removed generated navigation references

- Simplified version coverage and landing pages to point only at pinned raw checkouts.
- Removed generated navigation artifact wording from wiki overview and indexes.
